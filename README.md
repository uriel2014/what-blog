# what-blog

Using the Bootstrap Framework to construct a basic Bootstrap Blog Template.

Things to focus in this project:
Using an unordered list in the sidenav, this uses the nav-stacked for vertical
alignment.
We also need to focus on the input elements and the form elements that are
incorporated in the file.

We also incorporate more labels and badges for the comments. Keep in mind to
pay attention to the rows inside other rows as this plays an important role in
nesting comments.
